Summary
-------

This repository contains the MATLAB codes of a greedy algorithm for optimal
sensor placement of dynamical networks. The goal is to find a set of output
variables such that some given coefficient of observability is maximized. 
Details can be found in "Observability of Network Systems: A critical review
of recent results", by Arthur N. Montanari and Luis A. Aguirre (2019). 
Please, refer to this paper for further details.

The codes syntax were adjusted to be better aligned with the paper notation.
