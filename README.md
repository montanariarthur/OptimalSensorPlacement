# Optimal sensor placement for system observability
Greedy algorithm for optimal sensor placement in dynamical networks based on the system observability. The goal is to find a set of output variables (measurements) such that some given coefficient of observability is maximized.

# Usage

The following codes are direct implementations of the minimum sensor placement algorithm applied in Section 8.1.

- `coef_obsv.m`	: Computes the coefficient of observability of a pair (A,C).

- `greedysensorplac.m` : Optimal sensor placement based on a greedy algorithm and the coefficient of observability computed in `coef_obsv.m`.

- `greedypmuplac.m` : Adjusted version of `greedysensorplac.m` for the PMU placement application example (Section 8.1) in the context of power grids.
