# Optimal sensor placement for system observability
Greedy algorithm for optimal sensor placement in dynamical networks based on the system observability. The goal is to find a set of output variables (measurements) such that some given coefficient of observability is maximized.

Please, refer to this paper for further details. The codes syntax were adjusted to be better aligned with the paper notation. The contents of this repository were firstly reported at https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.22524.28803/1. 


# Usage

The following codes are direct implementations of the minimum sensor placement algorithm applied in Section 8.1.

- `coef_obsv.m`	: Computes the coefficient of observability of a pair (A,C).

- `greedysensorplac.m` : Optimal sensor placement based on a greedy algorithm and the coefficient of observability computed in `coef_obsv.m`.

- `greedypmuplac.m` : Adjusted version of `greedysensorplac.m` for the PMU placement application example (Section 8.1) in the context of power grids.
